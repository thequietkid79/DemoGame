# DemoGame

Just a demo game I created just to learn the GameMaker Engine. 
I just played around with a few things and made this basic platformer in a day or two. But just so I can keep learning, I will continue to add more and more features to this game just to make sure that I know how to put those features to use when I actually need them for a bigger purpose. So, do expect some key changes and additions to this game with time.

That's it. Now even if there is little to nothing to enjoy in this game, you can try and check your platformer skills if you want to by trying out this game. It's pretty lightweight and over in a few minutes. So, anyways, your choice.

You can try and download the game [here](https://github.com/thequietkid79/DemoGame/releases/).
